# FBProphet vs ARIMA

## Hypothesis
Using ARIMA learning tool, input stock price data and create short-term predictions for a particular stock. Using yfinance options pricing data we will compare against the predicted prices, calculating profit probability for various confidence levels of the predicted stock price. The end goal is to challenge our existing model (fbprophet) and determine which model is more accurate through backtesting.

## Technologies:
* [FB Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) - procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model
* [YFinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) - open-source tool that uses Yahoo's publicly available API for stock/options data
* [scipy](https://scipy.org/) - Fundamental algorithms for scientific computing in Python
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/) - fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
* [hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) - high-level plotting API for the PyData ecosystem built on HoloViews
* [holoview](https://holoviews.org/) - open-source Python library designed to make data analysis and visualization
* [pmdarima](https://pypi.org/project/pmdarima/) - statistical library designed to fill the void in Python's time series analysis capabilities
