# FBProphet vs ARIMA

## Hypothesis
Using ARIMA learning tool, input stock price data and create short-term predictions for a particular stock. Using yfinance options pricing data we will compare against the predicted prices, calculating profit probability for various confidence levels of the predicted stock price. The end goal is to challenge our existing model (fbprophet) and determine which model is more accurate through backtesting.
